# hcontortus_qtl

This primary focus of this project on QTL mapping ivermectin response in Haemonchus contortus.

The origin of the material analysed is the MHco3/MHco18 genetic cross performed by the BUG Consortium. The analysis of these data have been described previously in different ways, including
- genetic map (Doyle et al. 2018 GBE)
- XQTL genomics (Doyle, Laing et al. *in prep*)
- XQTL transcriptomics (Laing et al. *in prep*)

The main QTL experiment here is a dose response larval development experiment, in which two groups of larvae were collected:
- L3 that developed normally at high doses of ivermectin
- L1/L2 that were not developing well on low doses of ivermectin
We originally performed a poolseq experiment
